# Cooperative Air-Ground Robot Localization

Robust and reliable outdoor localization and inertial navigation remains challenging for autonomous robotic vehicles. Although Global Positioning System (GPS) devices are now ubiquitous, GPS may not operate reliably in certain locations (e.g. urban environments, forest canopies, mountain valleys, etc.) and can be subject to spoofing, jamming, or cyber attacks. With the expected deployment of multi-vehicle robot teams for many applications, one way to address this challenge is for robots to augment their existing localization solutions with peer-to-peer tracking information derived from other nearby robots. This approach is called cooperative localization. This project is a part of the course ASEN 5044 - Statistical Estimation of Dynamical Systems that we took with Dr. Tomoko Matsuo in Spring 2020 at CU Boulder.
